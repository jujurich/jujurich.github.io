    <h2> Pop Art Celebrities </h2>
    <img src = "steve4.png" alt = "steve" width = "500" height = "500">
    
    <p>I used Steve Harvey because he is one of the realest celebrities, he doesn't give into fame. He stays to himself.</p>
     <p> Steve is a television host mainly for family feud. I choose the colors for my subject's face by taking the color</P>
     <p> of his face and painting it with a brush. I used the swatches, crop tool, paint tool. </p>
   
    <br>
    
    <h2> Fantastic Beasts </h2>
    <img src = "3 animals.png" alt = "3 animals" width = "525" height = "375">

    <p> I came up with the animal I created by thinking of what can fit best. The animal can fly and he's quick and strong, </p>
    <p> like a running back. I wanted an animal with a big body, so I chose a panda. I wanted an animal with an intimidating face, </p>
    <p> so I chose a cheetah, and an animal with large wings, so I picked a vulture. I turned it into a hybrid by making the most </p>
   <p> essential part of the animals and putting all of that together to make the strongest. </p>
    
    <br>
    
  <h2> Activism Composite Collage </h2>
    <img src = "activism.png" alt = "" width = "525" height = "375">

    <p> My social justice topic is animal abuse and I choose it because it happens too often. It is important to me because they make the </p>
     <p> world better, they feed us, and provide us with nutrients, such as bees. People are cruel to animals for no reason, and I believe when </p>
     <p> it happens, it should be justified. Something the viewer should know is, every 60 seconds, an animal suffers abuse. I assembled the photos </p>
      <p> the way I did because some of these species aren’t on earth anymore because of the abuse, so I put them in heaven. </p>
    
    <br>
  
  
  
  <h2> Filtered Photo Kaleidoscopes </h2>
    <img src = "juju kaleidoscope.png" alt = "kaleidoscope" width = "525" height = "375">

    <p> We started by looking up a picture that was copyright free. The theme was halloween or fall so I picked halloween. </p>
     <p> I saw a pumpkin glowing in the dark night, it was pretty so that’s what I chose. I added layers on top of layers until it was pumpkins all around, </p>
    <p>  it turned out better than I thought it would look as a kaleidoscope. </p>
    
    <br>
  
  
  
  <h2> Mandala </h2>
    <img src = "mandala.png" alt = "mandala" width = "500" height = "500">

    <p> I made this project in adobe photoshop. Some of the steps I used were to make layers on top of layers. I made the layers in angles, </p>
     <p> transforming it, then stacking the layers on top of eachother. The shape I used was a boat. I made the boat purple and after duplicating the </p>
     <p> boat so many times, It turned into somewhat of a shuriken. </p>
