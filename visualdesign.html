    <h2> Pop Art Celebrities </h2>
    <img src = "steve4.png" alt = "steve" width = "500" height = "500">
    
    <p>I used Steve Harvey because he is one of the realest celebrities, he doesn't give into fame. He stays to himself.</p>
     <p> Steve is a television host mainly for family feud. I choose the colors for my subject's face by taking the color</P>
      of his face and painting it with a brush. I used the swatches, crop tool, paint tool. </p>

    <h2> Fantastic Beasts </h2>
    <img src = "3 animals.png" alt = "3 animals" width = "525" height = "375">

    <p> I came up with the animal I created by thinking of what can fit best. The animal can fly and he's quick and strong,
      like a running back. I wanted an animal with a big body, so I chose a panda. I wanted an animal with an intimidating face, 
      so I chose a cheetah, and an animal with large wings, so I picked a vulture. I turned it into a hybrid by making the most 
      essential part of the animals and putting all of that together to make the strongest. </p>
