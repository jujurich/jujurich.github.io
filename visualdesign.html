    <p>I used Steve Harvey because he is one of the realest celebrities, he doesn't give into fame. He stays to himself. Steve is a television host mainly for family feud. I choose the colors for my subject's face by taking the color of his face and painting it with a brush. I used the swatches, crop tool, paint tool. </p>
